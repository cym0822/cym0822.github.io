        "abstract": "Sentiment analysis, also called opinion mining, is a form of information extraction from text of growing research and commercial interest. In this paper we present our machine learning experiments with regard to sentiment analysis in blog, review and forum texts found on the World Wide Web and written in English, Dutch and French. We train from a set of example sentences or statements that are manually annotated as positive, negative or neutral with regard to a certain entity. We are interested in the feelings that people express with regard to certain consumption products. We learn and evaluate several classi\ufb01cation models that can be con\ufb01gured in a cascaded pipeline. We have to deal with several problems, being the noisy character of the input texts, the attribution of the sentiment to a particular entity and the small size of the training set. We succeed to identify positive, negative and neutral feelings to the entity under consideration with ca. 83\\% accuracy for English texts based on unigram features augmented with linguistic features. The accuracy results of processing the Dutch and French texts are ca. 70 and 68\\% respectively due to the larger variety of the linguistic expressions that more often diverge from standard language, thus demanding more training patterns. In addition, our experiments give us insights into the portability of the learned models across domains and languages. A substantial part of the article investigates the role of active learning techniques for reducing the number of examples to be manually annotated.",

        "abstract": "In the area of online communication, commerce and transactions, analyzing sentiment polarity of texts written in various natural languages has become crucial. While there have been a lot of contributions in resources and studies for the English language, \"smaller\" languages like Czech have not received much attention. In this survey, we explore the effectiveness of many existing machine learning algorithms for sentiment analysis of Czech Facebook posts and product reviews. We report the sets of optimal parameter values for each algorithm and the scores in both datasets. We finally observe that support vector machines are the best classifier and efforts to increase performance even more with bagging, boosting or voting ensemble schemes fail to do so.",

We pursue another aspect of opinion analysis: identifying the sources of opinions, emotions, and sentiments. We view this problem as an information extraction task and adopt a hybrid approach that combines Conditional Random Fields (Lafferty et al., 2001) and a variation of {AutoSlog} (Riloff, 1996a). While {CRFs} model source identi\ufb01cation as a sequence tagging task, {AutoSlog} learns extraction patterns. Our results show that the combination of these two methods performs better than either one alone.

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new method for sentiment analysis in Facebook that, starting from messages written by users, supports: (i) to extract information about the users\u2019 sentiment polarity (positive, neutral or negative), as transmitted in the messages they write; and (ii) to model the users\u2019 usual sentiment polarity and to detect signi\ufb01cant emotional changes. We have implemented this method in {SentBuk a Facebook application also presented in this paper. {SentBuk} retrieves messages written by users in Facebook and classi\ufb01es them according to their polarity, showing the results to the users through an interactive interface. It also supports emotional change detection, friend\u2019s emotion \ufb01nding, user classi\ufb01cation according to their messages, and statistics, among others. The classi\ufb01cation method implemented in {SentBuk} follows a hybrid approach: it combines lexical-based and machine-learning techniques. The results obtained through this approach show that it is feasible to perform sentiment analysis in Facebook with high accuracy (83.27\\%). In the context of e-learning, it is very useful to have information about the users\u2019 sentiments available. On one hand, this information can be used by adaptive e-learning systems to support personalized learning, by considering the user\u2019s emotional state when recommending him/her the most suitable activities to be tackled at each time. On the other hand, the students\u2019 sentiments towards a course can serve as feedback for teachers, especially in the case of online learning, where face-to-face contact is less frequent. The usefulness of this work in the context of e-learning, both for teachers and for adaptive systems, is described too.",

Opinions can be widely grouped into three categories good for positive, bad for negative and neutral and the process of analyzing differences of opinions and grouping them in all these categories is known as Sentiment Analysis.Data mining is basically used to uncover relevant information from web pages especially from the social networking sites. Merging data mining with other fields like text mining, {NLP} and computational intelligence we are able to classify tweets as good, bad or neutral. The main emphasis of this research is on the classification of emotions of tweets' data gathered from Twitter. In the past, researchers were using existing machine learning techniques for sentiment analysis but the results showed that existing machine learning techniques were not providing better results of sentiment classification. In order to improve classification results in the domain of sentiment analysis, we are using ensemble machine learning techniques for increasing the efficiency and reliability of proposed approach. For the same, we are merging Support Vector Machine with Decision Tree and experimental results prove that our proposed approach is providing better classification results in terms of f-measure and accuracy in contrast to individual classifiers.",
